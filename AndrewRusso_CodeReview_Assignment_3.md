This is a lot. That's not to say that's bad, just that there are a lot of moving parts and I can see why some of the other features got lost with the creation of the UI. The state data often opens in a browser page, which has both pros and cons. It will very much depend on the amount of data, where it is coming from, the individual users and their set up as to whether or not this will be appreciated. As I am a terrible speller and try to type this a google doc to check for errors, I’m forced to keep closing tabs. Since I have multiple monitors it is also a bit of extra movement each time. To be fair this is mostly me being nitpicky. The advantage is that you can pull up multiple states that might be far apart on the data grid view and be able to compare them side by side. The user would likely have a preference for one function over the other and getting that feedback would be important. The reality is that it is well put together and allows for the flexibility of being able to make this form either open additional windows or browser pages.

The data grid view feels a little cramped and I think adjusting some of the column widths to be smaller in some places, as well as increasing the height of the grid itself might really help with that feeling. I made mine fairly large, but I also think that can intimidate a user or leave some people feeling overwhelmed with the amount of data displayed, perhaps there is a solid middle ground between the two. I really liked having the wiki tied in here and having the drop down immediately change the datagrid is a nice touch too. It took me entirely too long to even notice the drop down and for a minute I could not understand why it would only open Alabama. I think adjusting its location or size (and possibly including a label?) might have this stand out more.

I don’t really know how to section off this one paragraph. I think this is stuff you’re aware of, but just hit time constraints while attempting something new and advanced, which I do think is super awesome. The edit button/form doesn’t seem to let me edit or delete an existing state, but will let me add a new one. There seems to be a variable “_currentState” for the state selected for updating/deletion, but there doesn’t seem to be a way for the user to pick a state? I’m not sure if this is coming from a different form or if there was meant to be a drop down for this. Selecting a state in the grid doesn’t affect this either. When I added a state it set the “ID” as “151” for some reason but that's not important and that whole field could be hidden anyway. When I added the state I could not put a population or median income over 100 and there was no way to add a flower, bird or colors. Adding these should be an easy future fix. Consider sanitizing and normalizing the user input for adds and edits. I managed to do this with a regex, but there are other ways to go about it. On the update page I would work on making the sidebar menu not cover up the data grid when fully expanded, if that is even possible..

I like the filter idea. As it stands it only filters out states that don't have data in a specific column (i.e. ones that I made to test), adding an entry field should greatly expand its use and functionality. So users can filter for stats who have blue as a state color for example. Moving back to the homepage doesn’t cause the state I made to add to the dropdown or to the data grid. There seems to be a variable “_currentState” for the state selected for updating/deletion, but there doesn’t seem to be a way for the user to pick a state? I’m not sure if this is coming from a different form or if there was meant to be a drop down for this. Selecting a state in the grid doesn’t affect this either.
