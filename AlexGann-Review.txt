The program is not only fully functional, but goes above and beyond the requirements of the assignment.
I particularly like the ability to pull up the Wikipedia page on the state.

I would have liked to see the image of the US in Form 1 better-centered. The top quarter of the country is
cut off. The collapsible menus are a nice touch, though it's not immediately obvious that they are collapsible
and they overlap some of the data. Otherwise, the interface is very nice as far as readability and usability.

Comments were simple but explanatory. I would have liked to see some more in certain sections, such as the
'Generate and Open HTML' method. Code was solid and well-written, though I saw at least one empty method.

Also, I found yo mama. She's a nice lady, be good to her.
